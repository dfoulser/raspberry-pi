Adafruit.com page describing how to configure and use the ADS1015 from Python.

And another page showing the wiring.  One thing I see I've done wrong is to 
wire ADDR to the GND pin on Rpi, rather than the GND pin on the ADC. I'll 
try changing that.

3V3 = 3.3 volts
5V = 5.0 volts

Why the 3V3 formatting?  Sounds like years ago it was common for the printing
of a "." character to get lost, so 3.3V might become "3 3V" and be hard to 
read.  

My device is a Raspberry Pi 3 model B.

GPIO pins have a max current to avoid damage to internal circuits.
Max is about 16mA per GPIO pin, with aggregate max over 26 GPIO pins of 100mA.

Updating all system software - I run into the bug that Canakit SD cards are
not able to format and update some size, net effect is that I lose USB access
(e.g., mouse & keyboard) on rebooting.
Download balenaEtcher and Raspbian-buster image, install that way on a new SD
card.  What I find is that the default Windows formatting request zaps the
card part way through install.  So install twice, formatting the first time and
just installing the second. Then it works.
