This library looks like a Py-wrapped C library that converts between Numpy arrays 
and sound files of various formats.  Examples of things you can do include:

    Block Processing

    Sound files can also be read in short, optionally overlapping blocks with soundfile.blocks(). For example, this calculates the signal level for each block of a long file:

    import numpy as np
    import soundfile as sf

    rms = [np.sqrt(np.mean(block**2)) for block in
        sf.blocks('myfile.wav', blocksize=1024, overlap=512)]

Adafruit.com page describing how to configure and use the ADS1015 from Python.
https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-analog-to-digital-converters/ads1015-slash-ads1115

And another page showing the wiring.  One thing I see I've done wrong is to 
wire ADDR to the GND pin on Rpi, rather than the GND pin on the ADC. I'll 
try changing that.

3V3 = 3.3 volts
5V = 5.0 volts

Why the 3V3 formatting?  Sounds like years ago it was common for the printing
of a "." character to get lost, so 3.3V might become "3 3V" and be hard to 
read.  

My device is a Raspberry Pi 3 model B.

GPIO pins have a max current to avoid damage to internal circuits.
Max is about 16mA per GPIO pin, with aggregate max over 26 GPIO pins of 100mA.

Updating all system software - I run into the bug that Canakit SD cards are
not able to format and update some size, net effect is that I lose USB access
(e.g., mouse & keyboard) on rebooting.
Download balenaEtcher and Raspbian-buster image, install that way on a new SD
card.  What I find is that the default Windows formatting request zaps the
card part way through install.  So install twice, formatting the first time and
just installing the second. Then it works.
